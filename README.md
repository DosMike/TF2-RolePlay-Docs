# TF2 RolePlay
This plugin goes back to 2007 when a community Half-Life 2: Deathmatch called Mannis Fun House opened their RP Servers.
I don't know what came first, MFH or SM Roleplay (which had a dedicated homepage at some point).
There were a few other RP Servers like Bernies or Cold Community RP which traded ownership multiple times iirc.
MFH was discontinued after HL2:DM was pretty much abandoned by VALVe somewhere around 2013(?) but continued as
Creme de la Creme Community, that shared pretty much the same staff members. Due to payment issues that community
was short lived and ended one or two years later. All customizations from that version of the RP plugin were mostly
rewritten when Daiiis Fun House opened RP servers based on the original MFH plugin. The two short lived iterations of
DFH ended partially due to the dying playerbase for HL2DM. The audience for "Make your own gameplay"-like online
chat games probably moved to GMod Dark RP and VR Chat. There was another attempt at bringin back HL2DM RP with
Ferinantes Fun House, but from what I was told that community was a bit missmanaged and didn't gather many players.
Based on FFH RP the TF2 version of the plugin required many rewrites of systems that would not work out of the box
int Team Fortress 2, due to the class and cosmetic systems. We also honor VALVe's request to not falsify player
inventories, giving only stock weapons although I miss custom player skins greatly.

Shoutout to all Community RP Servers bending Source Engine game rules over the years :)
