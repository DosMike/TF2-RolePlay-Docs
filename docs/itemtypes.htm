<h1>Item Types</h1>

<p>While in Team Fortress equipping items defines what Weapons, Hats and Taunts you have for a game it is important to understand, that the Roleplay item system described here is decoupled from your load out completely. It might be worth noting that any changes to your load out are temporary and do not carry over to other servers.</p>

<p>When joining a Roleplay server your load out is mostly left in tact, but your weapons will be removed, since this is not a action combat focused game mode. To re-gain weapons, health or ammo you will have to obtain items from vendors (NPCs) on the server for a soft currency you accumulate over time. Among combat items there are also other types of items you can obtain, as listed below.</p>

<p><b>Item types:</b>

<tbody><tr><td>Weapon</td><td>Gives you a weapon. In order to not upset Valve, we only hand out the base variations of weapons, even if your load out differs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ammo</td><td>Adds one clips worth of ammo to your reserve, up to max reserve ammo. If a weapon does not have reserve ammo it usually fills your weapon completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Molotov</td><td>This is a custom experimental item type for starting fires.</td></tr>
