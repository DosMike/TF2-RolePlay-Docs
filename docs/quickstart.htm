<h1>Game Play</h1>
<p>The RolePlay Server is in a way similar to the Silly Server. It does not represent any of the standard game modes and instead is intended to be more relaxed.
In contrast to the Silly Servers however combat can occur, even if extreme RDM is still prohibited!</p>

<p>The general idea of a RolePlay server is to mimic the life in a community. Walk around town, talk with friends, use your money to buy items or homes, etc.<br>
But there may also be robbing, gang wars, fights with the police and other stuff.</p>

<h2> The basics </h2>
<p>You will spawn without any weapons. Don't worry, you can keep your cosmetics!<br>
Acquiring weapons, items such as food, apartments and paying your bail to the police requires money on this server. Don't worry, this currency is a purely in-game currency.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can earn this currency by playing on the server (Your wage gets payed out once every minute, and increases over time as well)
</li><li> You can also enact one of the 5 Jobs with actual functionality (sorry, all other jobs are decorative)
</li><li> To boost your income, you can rob NPCs (this only works when cops are online) However! said cops might come after you if you choose a criminal lifestyle!
</li><li> You can rob NPCs by crouching and pressing "e" (or +use, call medic) twice! Remember to stay close to the NPC or the robbery might be aborted! Regular NPCs will hand over a maximum of 200€, bankers will hand over 300€
</li><li> If a player dies, a portion of money currently held on person will be dropped and any equipped weapons will be dropped/lost.
</li><li> You can interract with other players by pressing "e" on them! (also works by calling medic or +use)
</li><li> It is recommended to stay out of trouble if possible, remember that there's probably always someone bigger and stronger than you!
</li><li> As a lawful player, you may also earn money as a cop.
</li></ul>

<p>If you want to get into action, you can buy weapons from NPCs around the map and start defending yourself against cops or other civilians!
This is probably also a good place to tell you, that doing certain things will increase your crime counter. This includes hurting other players, robbing NPCs and waltzing around in restricted areas.<br>
While crime does decay over time, you'll probably get rid of it more quickly by getting jailed. Be aware though, that being cuffed means all your weapons are being confiscated!</p>

<p>For safety, you can purchase an apartment, get inside and lock your door. Maybe add some additional locks if you're afraid someone might disturb your peace.<br>
You can add all kinds of furniture to your apartment, color it and save it. For precise positioning, please ask staff for help (They get phys guns!) We allow for a maximum of 5 props saved to each apartment</p>

<p>Other than that, enjoy the map, find all secrets and enjoy your stay!</p>

<h2> The Crime System </h2>
<p>As mentioned before, you gain crime in combat, when hitting other players. The rate is 10 crime/hp. You also increase your crime counter when robbing NPCs (btw, bankers usually have more money).<br>
Walking around restricted areas and within large parts of the Police Department, you'll gain crime as well. But if you know where to look it might be worth it for some special items!</p>

<p>With increasing crime you'll get assigned with a crime level as well:
</p><table>
<tbody><tr><td> 1 </td><td> <span style="color:rgb(255,100,100);text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">1-999</span></td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td> <span style="color:rgb(255,255,0);text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">1000-1999</span></td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> <span style="color:rgb(255,200,0);text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">2000-3999</span></td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> <span style="color:rgb(255,150,0);text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">4000-7999</span></td></tr>

<p>As soon as a cop cuffs you, all you weapons will be gone. You can still escape arrest though, if your fellow players manage to kill the cop. In order to get you out of your cuffed state, you'll need to know someone with a cuffsaw. If you disconnect while being cuffed you'll be auto-jailed the next time you join.</p>

<p>If you get sent to jail either way, your sentence will be Your Crime Level +4 minutes. But fear not! You can pay a bail to get out early. The money goes directly to the cop jailing you. You may also ask someone on the outside to pay your bail for you via the Robocop that can be found within the police precinct. The robocop will charge a higher rate though!<br>
The bail will be your Wage until level 20. From there on it will be ⌊Wage/10⌋*10. This means you'll have to pay an extra wage check for every 10€/min you are over 20€/min.</p>

<h2> Apartments </h2>
<p>Apartments or houses are anywhere from €10.000 for the smallest aps over €30.000 - €50.000 for bigger ones and €250.000 for large areas (like factory halls, and other clan-base material).<br>
Once you purchased an apartment, you can name it by using /doorname on the main apartment door. Selling an apartment only returns a fraction of your money.<br>
As an apartment owner you can give out up to 5 additional apartment keys to your friends or trade these keys off to other players for money.</p>

<p>But what can you do with your apartment? Well first off, you can lock the door. This means whenever you are wanted by Police or other players, you can simply hide yourself in your apartment while you take a shower, eat something, etc. This does not prevent you from being AFK-Kicked! To lock and unlock your door, you can use +attack3 or the command !lockit while looking at the door. Be aware that other players can buy appropriate tools to open your door anyway. If this makes you feel insecure you can always buy and add additional Locks to your door. But no lock is absolutely safe as there are also lock breakers that can break those. So add one lock, add many, or however much you need to feel safe!</p>

<p>Additionally you can use the furniture system within your apartment. Spawn props, color them and finally save them. Every apartment can save a limited amount of furniture (5) so be aware of that! If you want a prop to be positioned in a specific way, you can always ask a staff member to use their physgun and position a prop for you. Don't bug them though, they are not your personal servants!</p>

<p>In order to give anyone a chance at owning an apartment/house the plugins will automatically kick you out after 60 days of not joining the server. This will throw all your saved furniture on the trash and replace all lock cylinders. The place will then go back up for sale.</p>

<h2 id="RDM"> About RDM </h2>
<p>Random DeathMatch describes attacking (that includes hitting) players at random. But what makes it random? Obviously if you run around attacking everyone you see without consideration like you would on a regular server, that'd be considered random. But that does not mean you can not PvP at all.</p>

<p>The most obvious way to PvP is Police vs Criminals. There is constant tension with police wanting to jail criminals but criminals wanting to keep weapons they might have equiped. Here gun fights should be expected.</p>

<p>With that said, you don't have to just take people punching you, blocking your way, stealing your weed, to name only some things. Self defence and revenge killing is allowed. Just try to not turn it into an endless war. If someone kills you once or twice out of the blue (maybe you spooked them, or they slipped their mouse button) this is not considered RDM by us. "Forgive and forget" or "an eye for an eye", the response in this case is up to you.</p>
